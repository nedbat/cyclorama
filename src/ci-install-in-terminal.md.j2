Try installing the library with `pip` again, but this time run it inside of
PyCharm, via its built-in terminal.

OR:

Use PyCharm's built-in menu for installing libraryes. You can open it by
navigating to View > Tool Windows > Python Packages.  Then you can search for
your desired package in the Search field and install it.
